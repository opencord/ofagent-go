// The implementation of the open flow agent (ofagent) uses a GRPC connection
// to VOLTHA accross several implementaton packages including the ofagent and
// openflow packages. This GRPC connection is shared through packages and type
// instances via injection.
//
// As the ofagent executes within a micro-service environment it is
// possible that the GRPC connection is reset (re-established). When the connection
// is re-established, because injection is used, the new value needs to be
// re-injected across the implementation.
//
// To help simply the re-injection or value change scenario a holder for the
// GRPC connection is established so that the reference to the holder can
// stay [sic] consistant over the lifetime of the ofagent while the underlying
// GRPC connection can change without walking the entire runtime structure.
